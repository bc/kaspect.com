# Kaspect Artificial Intelligence Intellectual Property (AIIP) Consulting

# What we do:
## Deep Learning and Algorithmic Design Consulting

Modern businesses will further expand their IP portfolios into the domains of deep learning and artificial intelligence. Formulating IP of this nature into a patent requires more than just a company and a patent attorney—it will take honed experience with algorithms, businesses, and a respect for the state of the art in academia and industry, from a voice outside of the technical team of the company. This alternative perspective is necessary to yield patents that become true assets for protection or sale.
