# Kaspect Artificial Intelligence Intellectual Property (AIIP) Consulting

# What we do:
## Deep Learning and Algorithmic Design Consulting

Through 2025, Modern businesses will further expand their IP portfolios into the domains of deep learning and artificial intelligence. Formulating IP of this nature into a patent, a licensable work, or as a well-documented trade secret requires more than just a company and a patent attorney—it will take honed experience with algorithms, businesses, and a respect for the state of the art in academia and industry. This is what is necessary to yield patents into true assets for protection or sale.
